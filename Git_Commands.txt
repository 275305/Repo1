1) 

 --> Git init

ls

git remote add origin <path of the git repo> 


--> git add .  [ which will add all the files from the current folder]
 
git status

--> git commit -m "Message to be readble for which activities going to be commited"

Just to add on to the other answers, before i knew my way around git, i was looking for some way to upload existing code to a new github (or other git) repo. Here's the brief that would save time for newbs:-

Assuming you have your NEW empty github or other git repo ready:-

cd "/your/repo/dir"
git clone https://github.com/user_AKA_you/repoName # (creates /your/repo/dir/repoName)
cp "/all/your/existing/code/*" "/your/repo/dir/repoName/"
git add -A
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push origin master

Alternatively if you have an existing local git repo

cd "/your/repo/dir/repoName"
#add your remote github or other git repo
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/user_AKA_you/your_repoName
git commit -m "new origin commit"
git push origin master
